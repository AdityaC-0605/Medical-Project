{"question":"58-year-old male with LDL 145 mg/dL, HDL 38 mg/dL, triglycerides 220 mg/dL, hypertension and diabetes.","contexts":["In high-risk patients, intensive LDL lowering and risk factor management reduce cardiovascular events.","Lifestyle intervention with diet, exercise, and diabetes control should be combined with statin therapy."],"ground_truth":"High cardiovascular risk dyslipidemia requiring intensive statin-based lipid lowering, risk factor optimization, and close follow-up."}
{"question":"Cardiac CT shows severe calcified plaque in left main coronary artery with greater than 70% stenosis and moderate plaque in RCA.","contexts":["Left main coronary artery severe stenosis represents high-risk coronary artery disease and usually warrants urgent specialist evaluation for revascularization decisions.","Secondary prevention includes antiplatelet strategy, high-intensity statin, blood pressure and glycemic control, and structured follow-up."],"ground_truth":"Severe high-risk multivessel coronary artery disease with urgent cardiology referral for angiography or revascularization planning and optimized medical therapy."}
{"question":"46-year-old female, screening mammogram reports clustered pleomorphic calcifications in upper outer quadrant, BI-RADS 4.","contexts":["BI-RADS 4 indicates suspicious abnormality and generally requires tissue diagnosis.","Pleomorphic clustered calcifications are associated with ductal carcinoma in situ and warrant biopsy."],"ground_truth":"Suspicious breast imaging finding requiring image-guided core biopsy and timely breast specialist follow-up."}
{"question":"Pathology report: invasive ductal carcinoma, grade 2, ER positive, PR positive, HER2 negative, Ki-67 18%.","contexts":["ER and PR positive, HER2 negative tumors are often treated with endocrine therapy planning after staging.","Tumor grade and receptor profile guide prognosis and adjuvant treatment recommendations."],"ground_truth":"Hormone receptor positive breast carcinoma with management focused on staging, surgical planning, and endocrine-based adjuvant strategy."}
{"question":"62-year-old male with LDL 190 mg/dL despite lifestyle changes, family history of premature MI.","contexts":["Very high LDL levels suggest severe hypercholesterolemia and usually require high-intensity statin therapy.","Family history of premature ASCVD increases risk and supports aggressive lipid lowering."],"ground_truth":"Severe hypercholesterolemia requiring high-intensity lipid-lowering treatment and close cardiovascular risk management."}
{"question":"Coronary CT angiography: proximal LAD stenosis approximately 75%, non-calcified plaque, patient has exertional angina.","contexts":["Significant proximal LAD stenosis with anginal symptoms indicates high ischemic risk.","Management typically includes urgent cardiology evaluation and consideration of invasive assessment."],"ground_truth":"Hemodynamically significant symptomatic coronary disease requiring urgent cardiology-directed escalation of management."}
{"question":"Breast ultrasound reveals irregular hypoechoic mass with spiculated margins, BI-RADS 5.","contexts":["BI-RADS 5 is highly suggestive of malignancy and requires prompt tissue diagnosis.","Spiculated irregular masses are high-risk imaging features for breast cancer."],"ground_truth":"Highly suspicious breast lesion requiring urgent biopsy and multidisciplinary oncology pathway initiation."}
{"question":"Biopsy: adenocarcinoma with perineural invasion, margins involved.","contexts":["Perineural invasion is an adverse histopathologic feature associated with higher recurrence risk.","Positive margins generally require re-excision or additional local therapy planning."],"ground_truth":"Adverse-pathology malignancy with involved margins requiring additional oncologic treatment planning and margin control."}
{"question":"55-year-old with HDL 30, triglycerides 320, LDL 130, obesity and poorly controlled diabetes.","contexts":["Atherogenic dyslipidemia with high triglycerides and low HDL increases cardiometabolic risk.","Management should combine lipid optimization with glycemic control, weight reduction, and lifestyle intervention."],"ground_truth":"Mixed dyslipidemia with elevated cardiometabolic risk requiring combined pharmacologic and lifestyle risk-reduction strategy."}
{"question":"CT report notes 50% left main narrowing and 60% mid-LCX stenosis, persistent chest tightness.","contexts":["Left main disease carries elevated prognostic risk even at intermediate stenosis.","Persistent ischemic symptoms with multivessel disease should trigger specialist evaluation and risk-stratified management."],"ground_truth":"Intermediate-to-severe multivessel coronary disease with symptoms requiring expedited cardiology evaluation and treatment optimization."}
{"question":"Mammogram shows asymmetry without suspicious calcifications, BI-RADS 3 recommendation for short-interval follow-up.","contexts":["BI-RADS 3 indicates probably benign finding and short-interval imaging surveillance is recommended.","Escalation to biopsy is generally reserved for interval progression or suspicious change."],"ground_truth":"Probably benign breast finding best managed with short-interval repeat imaging and clear follow-up instructions."}
{"question":"Pathology specimen: high-grade ductal carcinoma in situ with comedo necrosis.","contexts":["High-grade DCIS with comedo necrosis carries higher local recurrence risk and requires definitive local treatment planning.","Management decisions include surgery type, margin assessment, and radiation consideration."],"ground_truth":"High-risk in situ breast malignancy requiring definitive local control planning with multidisciplinary oncology input."}
