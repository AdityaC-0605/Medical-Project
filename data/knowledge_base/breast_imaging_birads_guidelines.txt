BI-RADS Breast Imaging Classification and Interpretation Guidelines

ACR BI-RADS ATLAS OVERVIEW
The Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) provides standardized breast imaging terminology, report organization, assessment structure, and a classification system for mammography, ultrasound, and MRI.

BI-RADS ASSESSMENT CATEGORIES

BI-RADS 0: Incomplete - Need Additional Imaging
- Description: Needs additional imaging evaluation
- Indications: Prior films not available, technically inadequate study
- Recommendation: Complete imaging workup before final assessment
- Clinical implications: Suspicious or normal, cannot determine without complete evaluation

BI-RADS 1: Negative
- Description: Nothing to report; no abnormalities
- Imaging findings: Completely normal study
- Recommendation: Routine screening
- Cancer risk: <1%
- Clinical action: Continue regular screening schedule

BI-RADS 2: Benign Findings
- Description: Benign finding with 100% certainty
- Common examples: Calcified fibroadenoma, skin calcifications, lipomas
- Recommendation: Routine screening
- Cancer risk: 0%
- Clinical action: No additional imaging needed

BI-RADS 3: Probably Benign
- Description: Finding with <2% probability of malignancy
- Common examples: Probably benign calcifications, focal asymmetry
- Recommendation: Short-interval follow-up (typically 6 months)
- Cancer risk: <2%
- Clinical action: Follow-up imaging to confirm stability

BI-RADS 4: Suspicious
- Description: Finding with moderate suspicion of malignancy
- Subcategories based on suspicion level:
  * 4A: Low suspicion (2-10% risk)
  * 4B: Moderate suspicion (10-50% risk)
  * 4C: High suspicion (50-95% risk)
- Recommendation: Biopsy should be considered
- Clinical action: Tissue diagnosis recommended

BI-RADS 5: Highly Suggestive of Malignancy
- Description: Finding with high probability of malignancy (>95%)
- Typical examples: Spiculated mass, segmental microcalcifications
- Recommendation: Appropriate action should be taken
- Clinical action: Biopsy and surgical consultation

BI-RADS 6: Known Biopsy-Proven Malignancy
- Description: Imaging after cancer diagnosis, before treatment
- Purpose: Monitor treatment response, evaluate extent
- Recommendation: Surgical planning, treatment monitoring
- Clinical action: Multidisciplinary management

MAMMOGRAPHY FEATURES AND INTERPRETATION

Mass Characteristics:
- Shape:
  * Round: Circular in shape
  * Oval: Elliptical or egg-shaped
  * Irregular: Neither round nor oval
- Margin:
  * Circumscribed: Sharp, well-defined borders
  * Microlobulated: Small undulating circles
  * Obscured: Hidden by adjacent tissue
  * Ill-defined: Poorly defined borders
  * Spiculated: Radiating lines from mass center
- Density:
  * High density: More dense than surrounding fibroglandular tissue
  * Equal density: Same density as fibroglandular tissue
  * Low density: Less dense than fibroglandular tissue
  * Fat-containing: Contains fat density areas

Calcification Characteristics:
- Morphology:
  * Benign: Skin calcifications, vascular calcifications, milk of calcium
  * Suspicious: Amorphous, coarse heterogeneous, fine pleomorphic, fine linear
- Distribution:
  * Diffuse: Scattered throughout breast
  * Regional: Larger area not conforming to duct distribution
  * Segmental: Conforming to duct distribution suggesting single duct
  * Linear: Arranged in a line suggesting ducts
  * Clustered: At least 5 calcifications within 1 cm

ULTRASOUND FEATURES
Mass Characteristics:
- Shape: Oval, round, or irregular
- Orientation: Parallel (wider than tall) or not parallel (taller than wide)
- Margin: Circumscribed, not circumscribed, ill-defined, angular, microlobulated, spiculated
- Echo pattern: Anechoic, hyperechoic, complex, hypoechoic, isoechoic
- Posterior features: Enhancement, shadowing, combined pattern
- Calcifications: Present or absent, macro or micro

Vascularity:
- Absent, internal, or peripheral vascularity
- Increased vascularity may suggest malignancy

Elasticity Assessment:
- Strain elastography: Ratio measurements
- Shear wave elastography: Stiffness measurements
- Higher stiffness suggests malignancy

MRI BI-RADS FEATURES
Enhancement Kinetics:
- Initial phase: Slow, medium, or rapid enhancement
- Delayed phase: Persistent, plateau, or washout pattern
- Type 1 (persistent): Usually benign
- Type 2 (plateau): Intermediate concern
- Type 3 (washout): Suspicious

Morphology:
- Shape: Round, oval, irregular, lobulated
- Margin: Smooth, irregular, spiculated
- Internal enhancement: Homogeneous, heterogeneous, rim enhancement, dark internal septations

CLINICAL MANAGEMENT GUIDELINES

Age-Appropriate Screening:
- Average risk: Begin at age 40, continue annually
- High risk: Begin earlier, may include supplemental imaging
- Personal history of breast cancer: Annual mammography + MRI

High-Risk Patient Management:
- Genetic mutations (BRCA1/2): Annual MRI beginning at 25, mammography at 30
- Family history: Consider earlier screening, supplemental imaging
- Prior chest radiation: Begin screening 8-10 years after exposure

Follow-Up Protocols:
- BI-RADS 3: 6-month follow-up for 2-3 years, then return to routine screening
- BI-RADS 4A: May consider vacuum-assisted biopsy
- BI-RADS 4B/C: Core needle biopsy recommended
- BI-RADS 5: Core needle biopsy + surgical consultation

Special Considerations:
- Dense breast tissue: May require supplemental imaging (ultrasound, MRI)
- Pregnancy: Ultrasound preferred, mammography only if necessary
- Breast implants: Special implant displacement views needed

PATIENT COMMUNICATION GUIDELINES
Risk Communication:
- Explain BI-RADS category in clear, understandable terms
- Provide absolute risk percentages when available
- Discuss benefits and risks of recommended procedures
- Address patient anxiety and concerns

Shared Decision-Making:
- Present all reasonable options
- Consider patient preferences and values
- Discuss impact on quality of life
- Provide educational resources

Safety Information:
These guidelines are for educational purposes and should not replace clinical judgment. Individual patient circumstances may modify general recommendations. All imaging interpretation should be performed by qualified healthcare professionals.
