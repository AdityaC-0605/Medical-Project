ACC/AHA Guidelines for Cardiovascular Disease Risk Assessment and Management

CHOLESTEROL MANAGEMENT GUIDELINES

LDL Cholesterol Risk Categories:
- Optimal: <100 mg/dL
- Near optimal: 100-129 mg/dL
- Borderline high: 130-159 mg/dL
- High: 160-189 mg/dL
- Very high: ≥190 mg/dL

Risk Assessment Considerations:
- LDL cholesterol is primary target for therapy
- Age, smoking status, blood pressure, and family history modify risk
- Diabetes mellitus is considered a coronary heart disease risk equivalent

HDL Cholesterol Interpretation:
- High HDL (≥60 mg/dL): Considered protective against cardiovascular disease
- Low HDL (<40 mg/dL in men, <50 mg/dL in women): Associated with increased cardiovascular risk

Triglyceride Classification:
- Normal: <150 mg/dL
- Borderline high: 150-199 mg/dL
- High: 200-499 mg/dL
- Very high: ≥500 mg/dL

Non-Pharmacologic Interventions:
- Therapeutic lifestyle changes should be first-line therapy for borderline abnormalities
- Dietary modifications include reduced saturated fat and increased fiber intake
- Regular aerobic exercise recommended for all risk categories
- Weight management for overweight individuals

Risk Enhancement Factors:
- Family history of premature cardiovascular disease
- Metabolic syndrome
- Chronic kidney disease
- Inflammatory conditions (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis)
- Elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein

Clinical Decision-Making:
- Treatment decisions should incorporate absolute cardiovascular risk
- Patient preferences and comorbidities guide therapy choices
- Regular monitoring of lipid levels recommended during therapy
- Lifestyle modifications should be emphasized regardless of pharmacologic therapy

Risk Communication:
- Explain cardiovascular risk in absolute terms (e.g., 10-year risk)
- Discuss benefits and risks of potential interventions
- Emphasize shared decision-making in treatment planning
- Provide educational materials about cardiovascular health
