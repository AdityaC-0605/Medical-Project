Breast Cancer Pathology: Grading Systems and Biomarker Interpretation

HISTOLOGIC GRADING SYSTEMS

Nottingham Histologic Grade (Modified Bloom-Richardson)
The Nottingham grading system assesses three morphological features, each scored 1-3:

Tubule Formation:
- Score 1: >75% of tumor forming tubules
- Score 2: 10-75% of tumor forming tubules
- Score 3: <10% of tumor forming tubules

Nuclear Pleomorphism:
- Score 1: Small, uniform nuclei with minimal variation
- Score 2: Moderate variation in size and shape
- Score 3: Marked variation in size and shape, prominent nucleoli

Mitotic Count (per 10 high-power fields):
- Score 1: 0-8 mitoses
- Score 2: 9-17 mitoses
- Score 3: >17 mitoses

Grade Calculation:
- Grade 1 (Well-differentiated): Total score 3-5
- Grade 2 (Moderately differentiated): Total score 6-7
- Grade 3 (Poorly differentiated): Total score 8-9

Clinical Significance:
- Grade 1: Better prognosis, less aggressive behavior
- Grade 2: Intermediate prognosis
- Grade 3: Poorer prognosis, more aggressive behavior

HORMONE RECEPTOR STATUS

Estrogen Receptor (ER) Testing:
- Positive: ≥1% of tumor cells showing nuclear staining
- Negative: <1% of tumor cells showing nuclear staining
- Clinical implications: ER-positive tumors may respond to hormone therapy
- Testing methods: Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is standard

Progesterone Receptor (PR) Testing:
- Positive: ≥1% of tumor cells showing nuclear staining
- Negative: <1% of tumor cells showing nuclear staining
- Clinical implications: PR status provides additional prognostic information
- Relationship to ER: PR-positive tumors usually ER-positive

Hormone Receptor Interpretation:
- Hormone receptor-positive (HR+): ER-positive and/or PR-positive
- Hormone receptor-negative (HR-): ER-negative and PR-negative
- Triple-negative: ER-negative, PR-negative, HER2-negative

HER2 STATUS TESTING

HER2 Protein Testing (IHC):
- Score 0: No staining or membrane staining in <10% of tumor cells
- Score 1+: Weak incomplete membrane staining in any proportion of tumor cells
- Score 2+: Moderate complete membrane staining in ≥10% of tumor cells
- Score 3+: Strong complete membrane staining in ≥10% of tumor cells

HER2 Gene Amplification (FISH/CISH):
- Positive: HER2/CEP17 ratio ≥2.0
- Negative: HER2/CEP17 ratio <2.0
- Equivocal: Ratio 1.8-2.2 (requires repeat testing)

HER2 Status Interpretation:
- HER2-positive: IHC 3+ or FISH-positive
- HER2-negative: IHC 0-1+ or FISH-negative
- HER2-equivocal: IHC 2+ with negative/equivocal FISH

Clinical Implications:
- HER2-positive: May benefit from HER2-targeted therapies (trastuzumab, pertuzumab)
- HER2-negative: HER2-targeted therapies not indicated

PROLIFERATION MARKERS

Ki-67 Proliferation Index:
- Low proliferation: Ki-67 <14%
- Intermediate proliferation: Ki-67 14-20%
- High proliferation: Ki-67 >20%
- Clinical significance: Higher Ki-67 associated with more aggressive disease
- Testing considerations: Inter-observer variability exists

Other Proliferation Markers:
- PHH3 (Phospho-histone H3): More specific for mitoses
- Cyclin D1: Cell cycle regulation marker
- p53: Tumor suppressor gene mutation marker

MOLECULAR SUBTYPES

Luminal A:
- ER-positive, PR-positive, HER2-negative
- Low Ki-67 (<14%)
- Best prognosis
- Hormone therapy effective

Luminal B:
- ER-positive, HER2-negative or positive
- Low PR or high Ki-67 (>20%)
- Intermediate prognosis
- May benefit from chemotherapy

HER2-enriched:
- ER-negative, PR-negative, HER2-positive
- Variable Ki-67
- Historically poor prognosis, improved with targeted therapy

Triple-negative/Basal-like:
- ER-negative, PR-negative, HER2-negative
- High Ki-67
- Poorest prognosis
- Limited targeted therapy options

ADDITIONAL PATHOLOGY FEATURES

Tumor Size (pT):
- pT1: ≤2 cm
- pT2: >2 cm but ≤5 cm
- pT3: >5 cm
- pT4: Extension to chest wall or skin

Lymph Node Status (pN):
- pN0: No positive nodes
- pN1: 1-3 positive nodes
- pN2: 4-9 positive nodes
- pN3: ≥10 positive nodes

Lymphovascular Invasion (LVI):
- Present: Tumor cells in lymphatic or blood vessels
- Absent: No tumor cells in vessels
- Clinical significance: Associated with higher recurrence risk

Surgical Margins:
- Negative (Clear): No tumor at inked margin
- Positive: Tumor at inked margin
- Close: Tumor within 1-2 mm of margin
- Clinical implications: Positive margins may require re-excision

ANCILLARY STUDIES

PD-L1 Testing:
- Indicated for triple-negative and HER2-positive metastatic disease
- CPS (Combined Positive Score) or TPS (Tumor Proportion Score)
- Clinical implications: May predict response to immunotherapy

BRCA Testing:
- Germline testing for hereditary breast cancer risk
- Indications: Early onset, family history, triple-negative disease
- Clinical implications: Surgical and systemic therapy decisions

Genomic Assays:
- Oncotype DX: 21-gene recurrence score
- MammaPrint: 70-gene signature
- Prosigna: PAM50 intrinsic subtype
- Clinical implications: Chemotherapy benefit prediction

QUALITY ASSURANCE

Testing Standards:
- CAP (College of American Pathologists) accreditation
- CLIA (Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments) certification
- External quality assessment programs

Pre-analytical Variables:
- Fixation time (6-72 hours in 10% neutral buffered formalin)
- Tissue handling and processing
- Specimen orientation

Inter-observer Agreement:
- Histologic grade: Moderate agreement (kappa 0.5-0.6)
- Hormone receptors: High agreement (kappa 0.8-0.9)
- HER2: High agreement with standardized protocols
