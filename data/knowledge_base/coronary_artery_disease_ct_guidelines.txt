Coronary Artery Disease: CT Coronary Angiography Interpretation Guidelines

CORONARY ARTERY ANATOMY
Major Coronary Arteries:
- Left Main (LM): Truncates into LAD and LCX
- Left Anterior Descending (LAD): Supplies anterior wall and septum
- Left Circumflex (LCX): Supplies lateral wall
- Right Coronary Artery (RCA): Supplies inferior wall and right ventricle

STENOSIS CLASSIFICATION
Stenosis Severity Categories:
- Minimal: <25% stenosis (hemodynamically insignificant)
- Mild: 25-49% stenosis (generally not flow-limiting)
- Moderate: 50-69% stenosis (may be significant with symptoms)
- Severe: 70-89% stenosis (typically flow-limiting)
- Critical: ≥90% stenosis (high-risk lesion)
- Total occlusion: 100% stenosis (complete blockage)

HEMODYNAMIC SIGNIFICANCE
Functional Assessment:
- Lesions <50% diameter stenosis: Rarely cause ischemia
- Lesions 50-70%: May be significant depending on:
  * Lesion length
  * Reference vessel diameter
  * Presence of collateral circulation
  * Myocardial territory at risk
- Lesions >70%: Generally considered hemodynamically significant

PLAQUE CHARACTERISTICS
Plaque Types and Clinical Implications:

Calcified Plaque:
- High-density on CT (>130 Hounsfield units)
- Generally stable, lower rupture risk
- Associated with chronic stable disease
- More common in older patients
- May be challenging for stent deployment

Soft (Non-calcified) Plaque:
- Low-density on CT (<50 Hounsfield units)
- Higher risk of rupture and thrombosis
- Associated with acute coronary syndromes
- More common in younger patients
- May indicate vulnerable plaque

Mixed Plaque:
- Combination of calcified and non-calcified components
- Intermediate stability characteristics
- Common in multi-vessel disease
- Requires comprehensive risk assessment

CLINICAL CONTEXT CONSIDERATIONS
Patient Factors Influencing Significance:
- Age and overall health status
- Presence of symptoms (angina, dyspnea)
- Functional capacity
- Comorbidities (diabetes, renal disease)
- Previous coronary interventions

Lesion Location Considerations:
- Proximal lesions: Higher clinical significance
- Left main disease: High-risk, often surgical consideration
- Bifurcation lesions: Complex, higher intervention risk
- Small vessel disease: Technical challenges

RISK STRATIFICATION
High-Risk Features:
- Left main stenosis ≥50%
- Proximal LAD stenosis ≥70%
- Multi-vessel disease with proximal lesions
- Vulnerable plaque characteristics
- Recent symptom worsening

Intermediate-Risk Features:
- Single vessel disease, non-proximal
- Moderate calcification
- Stable symptoms
- Good functional capacity

Low-Risk Features:
- Minimal or mild disease
- Distal vessel involvement
- No symptoms
- Excellent functional status

FOLLOW-UP RECOMMENDATIONS
Guideline-Based Surveillance:
- Minimal disease: Routine follow-up, risk factor modification
- Moderate disease: Consider functional testing, aggressive risk management
- Severe disease: Cardiology referral, consider intervention
- Critical disease: Urgent cardiology evaluation

Lifestyle and Risk Factor Management:
- Smoking cessation (critical for plaque stability)
- Blood pressure control (<130/80 mmHg)
- Lipid management (LDL targets based on risk)
- Diabetes control (HbA1c <7%)
- Regular aerobic exercise
- Weight management

Technical Considerations:
- Image quality affects diagnostic accuracy
- Motion artifacts can obscure lesions
- Heavy calcification may limit luminal assessment
- Contrast timing crucial for optimal visualization
- Multiple viewing angles recommended
